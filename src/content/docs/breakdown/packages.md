```python
import nextcord
from nextcord.ext import commands
import yaml
import asyncio
import subprocess
```

### NextCord:

NextCord was the way that I chose for the user's computer to interact with Discord. It is very simple and easy to use for small projects, like this one!

### PyYaml:

As described earlier, I wanted to make it easier for a common user to use the program, so this was the library that I decided to go with.

### AsyncIO:

I only used this module once, however, I used it to run the process, making it an integral part of the program.

### Subprocess:

The process itself, subprocess seemed easier than POpen, because I couldn't find any good documentation to send data to the subprocess.
