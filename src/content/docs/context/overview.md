This section will provide some background information about the application

## Origins

_Why did you bother to make this?_ You may ask. Well, the short answer is that my friend is often away from his computer, and my friends and I wanted to play on a Minecraft server that he was hosting. Eventually, I got fed up with him and decided to simply use a Chrome remote desktop to remote access his PC. The problem with CRD is that it times you out after about 30 minutes, so I was infuriated to try and fix anything. Then I developed FireStarter, a bot that was designed to start, stop, and manage the Minecraft servers through Discord. One afternoon, I sat down and wrote the entire bot in nodejs, probably my most experienced programming language, albeit not very well-liked among the programming community. (Not that Python is much higher, shoutout primeagen). That original program lasted me a long time, until the inevitable package dependency hell. My way of doing things quickly became deprecated, and since I now have to deal with a college workload, I stopped having time to maintain it. I archived the project as a cool little thing to put on my portfolio, and left it for a while.

## Reboot

When I moved into my dorms this year, I got new roommates and friends, who by coincidence, liked Minecraft and were active Discord users. I decided that since I already had the groundwork on a discord bot, and had the experience to create another one, I decided to rewrite the original bot into Python.

## The transition

Transitioning from JS to Python isn't extremely challenging, however, it most certainly comes with its ups and downs. For instance, the subprocess works completely differently between the two languages, so I had to figure out how to port my code so that it all worked properly.
